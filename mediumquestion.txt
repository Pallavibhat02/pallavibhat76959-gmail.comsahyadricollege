

2]Given an integer array of size n, find all elements that appear more than ⌊ n/3 ⌋ times.

The steps are as follows:

step 1]Initialize 4 variables:

step2] cnt1 & cnt2 –  for tracking the counts of elements
	el1 & el2 – for storing the majority of elements.
step3] Traverse through the given array.

step4]If cnt1 is 0 and the current element is not el2 then store the current element of the array as el1 along with increasing the cnt1 value by 1.

step 5]If cnt2 is 0 and the current element is not el1 then store the current element of the array as el2 along with increasing the cnt2 value by 1.

step 6]If the current element and el1 are the same increase the cnt1 by 1.

step 7]If the current element and el2 are the same increase the cnt2 by 1.

step 8]Other than all the above cases: decrease cnt1 and cnt2 by 1.

step 9]The integers present in el1 & el2 should be the result we are expecting. So, using another loop, we will manually check their counts if they are greater than the floor(N/3).
